I've been playing on Faeries SMP Minecraft server for a few months now. It's full of cute fairy cosmetics, fantasy builds and players of many different places and ages.

One time, I spent an evening help a player make a romantic spot for him and his girlfriend. He'd built an aisle and written a heavily typo'd love note in a book that he let me read. I planted flowers, a fountain, a picnic blanket with snacks and a gazebo to shield the area.

Being an economy server, there are player shops. These are warps (teleports) that a player can sell (or buy) wares at. I have two shops. One at /pw frills (obviously) which is a general store with things I want to get sell, I have some spawn eggs and custom heads, as well as obsidian and sand. I made a new player shop a few days ago, specifically to buy and sell dirt as that was one of my best sellers at /pw frills. It is called /pw dirtshop. I sell basic bitch dirt, and coarse dirt, and podzol, and grass, and mycelium. It's been very popular and has kept me busy keeping it stocked.

The server will reset before the end of the year, which is terrible and brilliant. But that is a few months off yet and I'll continue to serve the Faeries population with dirt until then.
