Tonight, I am going to go and give blood.

I haven't done this in years! Mostly because I have Just Forgot but partly because the first and only time I donated blood I got all woozy and I made the mistake (read: the sensible thing to do) in telling the nurses and they went into full recovery mode. The needle was whipped out of my arm, my legs were hoisted up above my heart and I was given a biscuit and a plastic cup of water.

It was mildly embarrassing. But to make things worse, it had all happened a few millilitres off the minimum amount for donation. At the time, I was scared of needles (the act of donating was part of 'flooding' therapy to help me get over my fear (10 years later I can confirm it did work)) so having it all for nothing was a gut punch.

The reason that it all happened was that I hadn't drunk enough throughout the day(s) before my appointment, which would have compensated for the blood lost by keeping my blood pressure high enough.

Tonight, I am going to go and give blood.

I booked my appointment a month ago because I was reminded of blood donation by a new project that has come through at work. It will be an animated personalised infographic based on the number of times you have donated blood. Reminding you of how much of an incredibly selfless act it is and how many lives can be impacted, nay, saved! by your act of kindness.

Tonight, I am going to go and give blood and I am drinking my weight in water.
