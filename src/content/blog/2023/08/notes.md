## 🎉 Work's birthday party
Ate pizza and doughnuts and pranced around taking selfies together

## 💻 User testing at work
Took part in some user testing for our latest project - first time I've done it in years and it was so very satisfying.

## 🍝 Friend's birthday meal
Delicious (vegetarian!) food and fancy drinks

## 🤖 Binged Simone Giertz on Youtube
My dog seems to love her voice so I popped on a video for her and ended up rewatching her content for hours. If you haven't heard of her before, she is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz">the Queen of Shitty Robots</a>

## ✨ Redesigned and refactored this site
The design wasn't working for me any more and I wanted a cleaner look with more flexibility in space usage.

## 🎪 Festival season!

Music, sun, mud, camping. Green Man highlights: <a href="https://www.voyamusic.co.uk/">Voya</a>, <a href="https://melinmelyn.bandcamp.com/">Melin Melyn</a>, <a href="https://www.selfesteem.love/">Self Esteem</a> (obviously) and <a href="https://sudanarchives.com/">Sudan Archives</a>.

## 🦠 Got sick
Caught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> at the festival. Second time I've been infected. Got it pretty bad, it was intense but quick.

## 🖥 Office tidy up and reshuffle
I took out the small crafting table, which I hadn't been using for anything other than junk, and replaced it with a rickety bookshelf that was stored in the garage. I've filled the bookshelf with some old notebooks, my collection of greeting cards, and my salt lamp. The room feels more intentional now and it's easier to get to the window
