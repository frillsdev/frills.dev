Community has always been there. Humans need it. It's part of the first three tiers of Maslow's Hierarchy.

So why do we feel like it is sometimes lost?

Pollution from disputes, non-human input, society collapse?

People seek community all around them. Church, family, chosen families, knitting groups, resistance movements. It grounds us and gives us a reason to be.

You hear a lot, when people reminise about the old web, and web revival, that the community was lost. Like it fell away into the ether of pixels and data packets.

But really, the community just went elsewhere. To Facebook, to Twitter, to Tumblr. The toil of making and maintaining a website (which let's be honest is not an easy feat) wiped away and the ability to just focus on making connections amplified.

The indie web is a community, so are group chats with your friends and talking to the cashier at your local shop. Community was always here and it's not going anywhere.
