I fell down the garden path, reading about digital gardens and the small web. Please follow me down...

1. Starting point: [Week 24, 2025 - ttntm.me](https://ttntm.me/likes/2025-w24/)
2. To this: [Small (web) is beautiful - fredrocha.net](https://fredrocha.net/2025/05/21/small-web-is-beautiful/)

3. To this: [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden - maggieappleton.com](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)

4. And this: [How the Blog Broke the Web - stackingthebricks.com](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)

5. Then this one that really got me considering the default chronological nature of blogs vs non-chronological gardens: [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog - joelhooks.com](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/)

6. Then this one: [Building a digital garden - tomcritchlow.com](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)
