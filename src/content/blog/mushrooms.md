## Deathcap
[Wild Food UK mushroom guide on Deathcap](https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/deathcap/)

Shiny. Not that remarkable. Gets slimy when it's wet.

There is no antidote. Symptoms start fairly quickly, with being sick, diarrhoea and stomach pain - that can last for days! Then you make a full recovery, then die from kidney and liver failure. Brutal. The poison, alpha-amanitin, kills liver cells and goes through the kidney to get recirculated to cause even more damage.

## Destroying angel

Supposedly very beautiful with it's pure white flesh, but is deadly. Apparently abundant in Scotland, take care my Scottish foraging friends!

Same symptoms as the Deathcap. Is that method just the Mushroom Way? Lure your victims into a false sense of recovery, then bang, liver failure.

Mushrooms are insane.
