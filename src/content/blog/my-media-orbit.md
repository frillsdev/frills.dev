I struggled with the name of this blog post.

What I want to encapsulate here is the kind of media that I consume on a frequent basis. 

Kinda inspired by [Ava's recent traded blog title: Personal Canon](https://blog.avas.space/trade-personal-canon/), but I have also been keen to share my common media consumption for a while.

So, here we are with 'Media Orbit'.

These are the constellations and planets that surround me, like the cycle of the moon, I'll return to these often:

## Podcasts
I'm not a big podcast listener. I rather listen to music, but there are a few that I listen to because my fiance listens to them and we enjoy them together when traveling in the car.
- [Lateral by Tom Scott](https://lateralcast.com/)
- [Let's Learn Everything by Caroline Roper, Tom Lum and Dr. Ella Hubber](https://www.letslearneverything.com/)
- [BBC World News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nq0gn/episodes/downloads) (this is one I listen to solo)

## TV & Video
- [Jet Lag: The Game](https://nebula.tv/jetlag)
- [Survive the Hunt by FailRace](https://www.youtube.com/@FailRace/)
- [Half As Interesting](https://www.halfasinteresting.com/)
- [Simone Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz)
- [Laura Kampf](https://www.youtube.com/@laurakampf)

## Music
- [K/DA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gOc8TsQed9eqnqJct2c5v)
- [Ariana Grande](https://open.spotify.com/artist/66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR)
- [City Girl](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6yby1ACnfwVigbSSaH3kEQ)

- [Pendulum](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MqnCTCAX6SsIYYdJCQj9B)

## Newsletters
I don't subscribe to many newsletters. My emails are a bit of a wild west, I much prefer using RSS, however these are some of the ones that are good enough to send me a notification when then drop.
- [a11yweekly](https://a11yweekly.com/)
- [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)
- [oxymoron by Tom Greenwood](https://tomgreenwood.substack.com/)
- [Curiously Green](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/curiously-green/)
- [Pansy Shop](https://www.pansy-shop.com/)

I found it tough to know where to draw the line. There is plenty more media that I consume on a semi-regular basis, but things can fall off my radar for a few months then I have a binge. The collection above are ones that I am generally quite good at keeping up with, or keep returning to habitually.
